# Currency Exchange Rate Forecasting Using Python

This repository contains a project that predicts **currency exchange rates** using Python. By analyzing historical exchange rate data, this project employs data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to forecast future exchange rates.

## 📌 Overview

Accurate forecasting of currency exchange rates is critical for businesses, traders, and individuals dealing in international markets. This project demonstrates the implementation of **time series forecasting models** to predict exchange rates and provide actionable insights.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Visualize trends, seasonality, and patterns in exchange rate data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and time series transformations.
- **Forecasting Models**:
  - Time series models: ARIMA, SARIMA.
  - Machine learning models: Linear Regression, XGBoost.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared scores.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, XGBoost and Statsmodels.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook.

cd demand-forecasting-optimization
```

2.	Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📚 Usage

1.	Place the exchange rate dataset in the data/ directory.
2.	Run the **EDA and Preprocessing notebook** to clean and explore the data.
3.	Experiment with different forecasting models in the **Forecasting Models notebook**.
4.	Visualize and evaluate the results.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

-	Incorporate deep learning models like LSTM for advanced forecasting.
-	Automate data fetching from live APIs for real-time predictions.
-	Build a dashboard for interactive analysis and deployment.
